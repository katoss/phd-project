# Open Humans Personas List

<details>
  <summary><b>What are personas and what are they used for?</b></summary>
  Personas are archetypical fictional characters representing different user types that might use the platform. While fictional, they should not be "made up", but based on user research, so they can serve as a realistic representation of possible user groups and help to understand their needs, background, behaviour and goals. 
  
  Personas are used as a method in the ideation process to empathise with users, prioritize them and get an insight into what kind of platform could be useful to help users reach their goals. For the design team, they can serve as mnemonic devices to make user needs more tangible and memorable. 
  
  For example, one could try to sketch "the perfect front page" for each persona, according to their needs and see how they overlap or diverge, or think about the goal "I want to find an efficient way to make sense of my sleep data" and how each persona could reach this goal.
  
  Important: Personas represent archetypes; real world individuals are likely to represent multiple personas, and which persona they resemble may vary depending on context (e.g. type of self research) and change over time.

  <summary><b>How did you make these personas?</b></summary>
  
  These personas were developed iteratively in an collaborative effort by the members of the [Peer-Produced Research Lab](https://peer-produced.science/), mainly in several group discussions and tasks. Two members of the team are the founders and long-term members of the Open Humans community, and two other members led 20+ interviews with Open Humans community members and other people interested in self-research on motivations, peer support and learning. This experience served as the user-research basis to develop a representative set of personas for the (current and future) target user groups of Open Humans.
  If you are member of the community and you don't feel represented by one or a mix of several of these personas and think we should add or adapt anything, you are very welcome to give us feedback.

<details>
  <summary><b>Are these personas finished?</b></summary>
  
  These personas are thought to be a method that serve a purpose (helping to redesign Open Humans in a user-centered way) and are thus thought to be living documents that can change with the tasks they are used for and/or with the community feedback we receive. There is no one right way to make personas, what dimensions to include etc., they are rather a method to be evaluated and improved in the design process.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Does the order of the personas have a meaning?</b></summary>
  
  Yes and no. The personas in this list are split into two groups, those prioritized as target groups (above the line) and those not prioritized (beneath the line). Within these groups, we tried to roughly sort the personas according to priority, but came to the (preliminary) conclusion that a functioning peer-production environment might need all of these user types to work. We will try to find out during the process, if a further prioritization is possible and/or necessary.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What do/did you use these personas for?</b></summary>
   
   So far, the persona creation (and thus, thinking about important user groups and their needs) was the first step in a user-centered design process. We will try to include them in the next steps of user research, for example together with te ["Jobs to be done"](https://www.designmethodsfinder.com/methods/jobs-to-be-done) method.
   
   More information on how these personas were used will be added here in the process.

### Personas underneath this line not prioritized*

<details>
  <summary><b>*What does it mean that these personas are not prioritized and why are they part of this list? </b></summary>
  
There are many different types of people potentially interested in Open Humans for various reasons and with various goals and expectations. 
When designing a platform, or another product of any kind, it is important to think about what types of users it is primarily intended for.
It is because one shoe does not fit all - and it is hard to build something that meets the needs of everyone.
This does not mean that we want to exclude these (archetypical) people from using Open Humans, but that we don't focus on them when designing
the platform. The reasons for this are diverse. For example, it could be that we think that their requirements could be better met by other 
platforms or apps, or they could be looking for something that was already tried in Open Humans but did not work out so well in the end. 
We included these personas in the list, because often during designing something it is helpful to visualize what *not* to build and what *not* to 
focus on instead of only thinking about what to build and to focus on.

|   IMAGE               | *“I really have to force myself to track all these things.”* <br> Ryan was advised by their doctor to try self-tracking to monitor their blood pressure, nutrition and physical activity. They find it really tedious and laborious to implement a tracking routine in everyday life and want to invest as little time and effort as possible. |

|-----------------------|----------------------|
|   IMAGE               | *“It is so easy to track all these things with my Apple watch! Amazing what these gadgets are capable of these days.”* <br> Charlie gradually got more into self-tracking with the advancement of the mobile devices they use in daily life. They are satisfied with the default settings and casually having a look at their step count or pulse. Charlie also finds the prompts reminding them to move more in daily life quite useful and is satisfied with their new device. |
| **Motivation**        | Self-tracks because it is convenient and the devices “do it automatically”, so there is little work involved |
