**Important:** These personas represent archetypes; real world individuals are likely to represent multiple personas, and which persona they resemble may vary depending on context (e.g. type of self research) and change over time.

  <summary><b>*What does it mean that these personas are not prioritized and why are they part of this list? </b></summary>
  
There are many different types of people potentially interested in Open Humans for various reasons and with various goals and expectations. 
When designing a platform, or another product of any kind, it is important to think about what types of users it is primarily intended for.
It is because one shoe does not fit all - and it is hard to build something that meets the needs of everyone.
This does not mean that we want to exclude these (archetypical) people from using Open Humans, but that we don't focus on them when designing
the platform. The reasons for this are diverse. For example, it could be that we think that their requirements could be better met by other 
platforms or apps, or they could be looking for something that was already tried in Open Humans but did not work out so well in the end. 
We included these personas in the list, because often during designing something it is helpful to visualize what *not* to build and what *not* to 
focus on instead of only thinking about what to build and to focus on.
